# strobfus
*strobfus* provides a simple tool to obfuscate sensible strings inside Go binaries, when you have no other choice but to put them there.
```
$ go get -u github.com/diegosz/strobfus
```
## Usage
Place your sensible strings inside a dedicated file with the right `go generate` clause, e.g.:
```go
// +build ignore

package api
//go:generate strobfus -filename $GOFILE
var API_KEY = "MY_API_KEY"
```

*(Note the `// +build ignore` directive, you obviously don't want those strings to end up in your binary)*


Upon generation, *strobfus* will create a new file (`${filename}_gen.go`, by default) that contains each string in a properly encrypted form, using AES-128 with a random key.  
That same key is stored in the generated file too, and will be used to decrypt the content of each string at run time (via `init()`).

## Good to know

*strobfus* is just a deterrent that prevents kind-of sensible data from appearing in clear form in the output of binary analysis tools such as `objdump`, `strings`, etc.  
It is **not** a security measure per-se; anyone experienced with the use of a debugger should be able to retrieve the AES key from the final executable.
